# Docker
### This is my first Docker testing project that checks whether the source-code with Docker file runs correctly
This is a test file with very simple php file that outputs a text, and the localhost will output the text that's from the php file.
Docker is the platform where apps and interfaces can be stored as images to run as a container. 
Docker can benefit from virtual machines in terms of convenience. 
Docker can handle files and packages in any environment, and require less power and space.
